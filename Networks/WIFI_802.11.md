## Chapter 1: Introduction to Wireless LANs and Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi refers to a set of wireless networking technologies defined by the IEEE 802.11 standards. These allow devices to communicate without physical cables within a local area network (LAN).

**Key Concepts:**

* LAN vs WLAN
* IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance
* Use cases: home, enterprise, public hotspots

## Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Radio Transmission

Wi-Fi operates over radio frequencies. Understanding RF principles is key to mastering Wi-Fi.

**Core Principles:**

* Electromagnetic spectrum: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands
* Wave properties: frequency, wavelength, amplitude
* Signal propagation: reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering
* Path loss and free space loss

| 802.11ac | 2013         | 1.3 Gbps+ | 5 GHz           | MU-MIMO, Beamforming      |
| 802.11ax | 2019         | 9.6 Gbps  | 2.4/5/6 GHz     | OFDMA, BSS Coloring       |
| 802.11be | 2024 (exp.)  | 30 Gbps+  | 6 GHz           | Extremely High Throughput |

## Chapter 4: Wi-Fi Architecture and Components

**Essential Components:**

* **Station (STA):** Client device
* **Access Point (AP):** Bridges wireless to wired LAN
* **Basic Service Set (BSS):** One AP and associated STAs
* **Extended Service Set (ESS):** Multiple APs with same SSID

## Chapter 5: Wi-Fi Frame Types and Structures

Wi-Fi uses specific frame types for different operations:

* **Management Frames:** Beacon, Probe Request/Response, Association, Authentication
* **Control Frames:** RTS/CTS, ACK
* **Data Frames:** Actual payload transport

**MAC Frame Structure:**

* Frame Control
* Duration/ID
* Address 1 (Receiver)
* Address 2 (Transmitter)
* Address 3 (Filtering)
* Sequence Control
* Address 4 (for WDS)

## Chapter 6: Channel Access and Medium Contention (CSMA/CA)

Wi-Fi uses **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance**:

1. Listen before transmit (Carrier Sensing)
2. Wait if busy (Backoff using DIFS, SIFS)
3. Optional RTS/CTS to reserve the channel

## Chapter 7: Modulation and Coding Techniques

Wi-Fi adapts modulation and coding based on signal quality:

* **Modulation Types:** BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, 1024-QAM
* **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing):** Splits channel into subcarriers
* **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output):** Uses multiple antennas
* **Coding:** Forward Error Correction (FEC), convolutional and LDPC codes

## Chapter 8: Security in Wi-Fi Networks

Security protocols:

* **WEP (Deprecated)**: Weak encryption (RC4)
