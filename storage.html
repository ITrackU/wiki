<h1><strong>How to access files/folders</strong></h1>
<p>To access files/folders in NextCloud you must use different approach then you are used to.</p>
<p>First, you need to click on the file/folder you want to open.</p>
<p>When you do that pop-up window will appear in right side of the screen that will give you all the information about that particular file/folder.</p>

<p>We use the same procedure for opening files.</p>
<p>The only difference is that files with a format that is unknown to NextCloud will be downloaded directly to users personal computer while others will be opened directly within the application.<br>​</p>
<h1><strong>Create new Folder/Text file</strong></h1>
