<p>At BigaCloud.com, the security and privacy of your data are our top priorities. We adhere to a rigorous data retention policy, ensuring maximum protection of your personal information. No user data is stored without encryption, meaning your information is stored securely and unintelligible to any unauthorized individuals. Additionally, access to your data is strictly limited to yourself, ensuring total control over your information.</p>
<p>In line with our commitment to privacy, no logs are retained beyond two weeks. This measure reinforces our dedication to transparency and ensures that any traces of activity are regularly erased, minimizing potential risks associated with prolonged data retention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our connection statistics are compiled anonymously, preserving your privacy. This approach ensures that aggregated information does not allow for the individual identification of users while providing us with relevant data to continually improve our service. At BigaCloud.com, we are committed to delivering an online experience that is not only high-performing but also secure and respectful of your privacy.</p>
