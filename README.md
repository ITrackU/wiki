## Introduction

As an IT professional specializing in integration management, I focus on building containerized application infrastructure with GPU acceleration using NVIDIA CUDA. My expertise includes automation with Ansible and Kubernetes, paired with a strong interest in cybersecurity through continuous pentesting education.

I also maintain a self-hosted cloud server for personal services including email, password management, storage, and task automation—demonstrating my practical skills across various technologies. My career goals involve transitioning into DevOps and cloud engineering roles, leveraging infrastructure-as-code and automation for scalable, secure environments.
